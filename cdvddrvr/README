CDVDDRVR is an open-source CD/DVD driver for PS2 which is intended as a replacement for rom0:CDVDMAN and eventually
rom0:XCDVDMAN.  Unlike CDVDMAN, CDVDDRVR does not include any code for filesystem interaction.  The ISO9660
file-system functions have been split off as a seperate module named ISOFS(see ISOFS for more information).
